# README

This repository contains the code produce the analyses, figures, and manuscript for: Taff & Shipley, Inconsistent shifts in warming and temperature variability negatively impact avian fitness.

There are three code files and several folders included in the repository.

The repository is arcived on Zenodo.

*1. Full_analysis_supplement.Rmd*

This single script does all the data loading, cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and plotting for the entire manuscript. Distinct analysis tasks are divided into sequential code chunks. All of the data used in our analysis was accessed from publicly available databases (breeding records from Nestwatch, Project Nestwatch, and Project Martinwatch; temperature records from NOAA and ECC Canada). We accessed these records by completing appropriate data use agreements and so we do not include the raw data with this repository, but all raw data can be accessed directly from those sources. For accessing temperature records, a free API key should be requested and inserted into the code. These steps will need to be taken before the full code can be executed, but we have included most of the key outputs from the code as saved data objects within the repository that can be loaded for examination (e.g., models, figures, tables). These are included either in the folders '2_modified_data' or '4_output_figures'.

*2. Manusript.Rmd*

This markdown script reproduces the entire typeset manuscript with citations, figures, and tables. It loads the saved output from file 1 as required. References and figures saved as images are included in the same folder for loading and a knitted pdf version of the manuscript is also included in the folder.

*3. Online_appendix.Rmd*

This markdown script produces a summary html file that has full model tables for every model presented in the paper along with basic plots for some of those models. The script relies on saved objects from document 1 above, so it can be executed without accessing raw data. A knitted html version is also included in the repository.
